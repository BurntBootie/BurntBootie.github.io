       <p style="font-family:tahoma;color:#000000;font-size:125%">  Some people argue that Globalization is good or bad and that if it should be stopped or slowed. I think that globalization should always be promoted. Globalization includes multiple things. Some of these are labor markets, economic growth and development, rights of citizens, resources and income distribution. Labor markets are the nominal markets in which workers find paying work, employers find willing workers, and wage rates are determined. Economic growth is an increase in the amount of goods and services produced per head of the population over a period of time.</p>
       <p style="font-family:tahoma;color:#000000;font-size:125%">China has experienced great benefits from globalization over time. China has benefited hugely from globalization which is shown in its high GDP growth.China has been growing significantly over the last 35 years because of its trading with other countries. But recently the market has been declining as shown with a GDP Growth of 9.5% in 2011, 7.8% in 2012, 7.7% in 2013 and 7.3% in 2014. Overall, chinese companies are getting bigger and stronger and as a result China is rapidly industrialising itself . China's labor markets have been transformed to an increasingly market-driven system. Everything that is in their market is being competed against all around the world. The U.S. has in the past year has had the labor market job grow at an average rate of about 235,000 new jobs per month. This is a constant increase of jobs over 69 months. The United states is growing at a slower rate than china but still otherwise an increase. In 2011 the GDP growth was 1.6%, in 2012 the GDP was 1.2%, In 2013 the GDP was 2.2%, In 2014 the GDP was 2.4%. In the last 2 years you can see that the GDP is growing slightly more but still more.</p>
       <p style="font-family:tahoma;color:#000000;font-size:125%">Some people can argue that Globalization is using finite resources too quickly. China as an example is gaining the majority of their energy by using coal. This problem will be solved when the proper technology is created to take coalsâ€™ position.</p>
