<p>My Most Recent Problem I Had To Figure Out Was How To Use REQ Points Efficiently On Halo 5. When I First Started Playing I Was Drawn To Buy The Gold Packs, But Far Long After, I Realized That Instead Of Wasting REQ Points On Golds For A Chance At Legendaries It is Better To Unlock Things In Chronological Order.</p>
