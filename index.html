       <p style="font-family:tahoma;color:#000000;font-size:125%">Some people argue that Globalization is good or bad and that if it should be stopped or slowed. I think that globalization should always be promoted. Globalization includes multiple things.Some of these are labor markets, economic growth and development, rights of citizens, resources and income distribution. Labor markets are the nominal markets in which workers find paying work, employers find willing workers, and wage rates are determined. Economic growth is an increase in the amount of goods and services produced per head of the population over a period of time.
